# Amazon Clone Project
For education purposes, this repository contains a simple amazon frontend clone. This was inspired by the [following tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF68MNDxVwU) but this version contains a few differences including dependencies used and some architecture decisions.

## Functionalities
- Simple store feed
- Checkout page
- Payments via stripe
- Placed orders page

## Important Note
If you're using this repo simply to grab the final source code, keep in mind that **this is not the development repository**. That repository is private for security reasons (for instance contains the firestore permission.json file). So besides that file and the enviroment variables, this repo contains the entire source code.

## Technology stack:
- React Js
- Next Js
- Stripe
- Tailwind Css
- HeroIcons
- Redux
- Firestore
- NextAuth
